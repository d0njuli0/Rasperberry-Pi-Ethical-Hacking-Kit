# Raspberry Pi Setup

The first step in setting up your Raspberry Pi begins with unboxing it and assembling the hardware components.

1. Apply heat sinks onto the RPI, it comes with three in total.

2. If you purchased the kit and are using a 5v fan, then the fan must be plugged into pins 4 and 6. If you are unsure, you can open a shell and type `pinout`.

3. Separate the two pieces of the plastic case and safely seat the RPI inside of it.

4. Insert the SD card into a computer or laptop and flash an OS onto it. For this project, we’re using the latest release of Kali Linux. The imager made specifically for RPI’s can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), with a more in-depth guide on flashing and configuring an OS (with Wi-Fi, SSH settings, etc). Once finished, safely eject the SD card and insert it into your RPI.

5. By this point, your RPI is in the final stages of setup. All that remains is plugging in the necessary cables for your setup (ethernet if you choose not to use Wi-Fi, power cable, HDMI).

6. Power on your RPI and allow it to fully boot. If all of the previous steps were done correctly, your RPI should display the login screen for Kali Linux. The default credentials are: 
   - User: Kali
   - Password: Kali
