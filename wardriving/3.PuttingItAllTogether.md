# Introduction
- With Kismet and GPDS configured to work with eachother, you can now start the final steps. GPSD and Kismet must be started, and after scanning, the result is a file that must be converted into a .csv so it can be uploaded to Wigle. At this point, your RPI should have all of your hardware (network adapater, GPS adapter) connected

# Running Kismet and GPSD

- Open a terminal window and type `sudo gpsd -D 5 -N -n /dev/ttyUSB0`. Open a second terminal window and type `sudo kismet`. As we've seen from the tests before, Kismet will run and start outputting data. We'll do the same technique we used in the earlier document to access Kismet through a web browser on a seperate device. Again, I recommend you don't attempt using the default Firefox web browser on the Pi and instead use a seperate device that's connected to the same network, since running Kismet and opening Firefox has about a 95% chance of your RPI becoming entire unresponsive (in our experience). Anyways, open a web browser and type your RPI's IP address (`ifconfig` will help) with the port 2501 into a web browser. It should look something like `125.246.0.1:2501`. The result should be the Kismet UI displaying. If it's your first time using it, it'll ask you to register for an account. Either way, sign in to Kismet. The UI should look like this:

  ![kismet](https://github.com/d0njuli0/Rasperberry-Pi-Ethical-Hacking-Kit/blob/main/images/kismet.png?raw=true)

  - Click on the three lines at the top left and click `Data Sources`. Your available networking interfaces will display. Click on the tab for `wlan1` and then click `Enable Source`. `wlan0` is the onboard network adapter, so don't choose that one.
  - You should now be able to see the output of data. There's other information to look at, but the important thing is that we see a GPS location in the top right. All of that should confirm Kismet is working as intended and you're (technically) ready to start Wardriving. But before that, we'll go over what to do when you finish a scan and want to upload it.

# Converting the Results
- At this point, we're assuming you've finished a scan and want to upload the file to Wigle. For mapping a Wardrive, Wigle accepts .csv files for upload. Since Kismet, by default, will produce `.kml` files, we need to convert it to a `.csv`. Thankfully, Kismet comes with a tool for this exact thing. To run the conversion tool, you'll need to type `kismetdb_to_wiglecsv --in some-kismet-log-file.kismet --out some-wigle-file.csv` into a terminal window. The `some-kismet-log-file.kismet` part will be the file that Kismet just produced from your scan which should be named something to the effect of `Kismet-20240401-15-47-46-1.kismet`. The first set of numbers is the date the file was created, so that'll help with any orginizational confusion. The `some-wigle-file.csv` part can be named whatever you want. Just for an example, the entire command should look something like `kismetdb_to_wiglecsv --in Kismet-20240401-15-47-46-1.kismet --out WardriveTest.csv`. Once the file is converted, send it over to a computer. Do this however you want, a flashdrive or through FTP. There's plenty of ways.

# Uploading to Wigle
- Now that you've sent the file to a PC, you can upload it to Wigle. Go to `wigle.net` and create an account. Click on the `Uploads` tab at the top and you should've landed here:

  ![wiglescreen](https://github.com/d0njuli0/Rasperberry-Pi-Ethical-Hacking-Kit/blob/main/images/wiglescreen.png?raw=true)

- The next step is obvious, just click `Upload a File` and select the .csv file you recently transferred. Depending on the size of the file, the time to upload will vary. The three minute scan I did while just sitting in my room took around 25 minutes to upload. The actual Wardrive we did (maybe ~10 minute drive) took around 45 minutes to upload. Just let it do it's thing. Once it's finished, it'll give you a little bit of info about your scan. Not necessarily important, but it's still cool to see how many new additions you've made to the map.

- Once that's all said and done, hover over the `View` button at top and click `Map`. The map shown is the entire Wigle community map of areas that have been Wardriven. If you successfully uploaded to the website, you've now contributed to the map. There's filtering selections on the right side, and if you wanna just see what your exact contribution was, toggle `Only Discovered by Me`. You should (hopefully) see some purple dots forming a line in the area you drove. For privacy reasons, I won't share the image of our contribution.

  # Conclusion
  - That's the entirety of our Wardriving process. I'll expand upond our exact Wardrive experience and how we set that up in the final document.
