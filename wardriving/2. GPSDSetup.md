# Introduction
- Per the GPSD source website, `gpsd` is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPS recievers attached to a host computer through serial or USB ports. In this project, GPSD will be combined with Kismet to map networks and devices and attribute each one with a fixed GPS location.

# Setup
- In this project, we're using the [Waveshare L76X](https://www.waveshare.com/l76x-gps-hat.htm). Personally I would recommend going the easier route and using a USB GPS receiver that you'll find on literally any other Wardriving guide. With this receiver, connecting it via serial ports was a pain for various reasons. Instead, we ended up just swapping the jumper caps and plugging it in via USB. At least with the receiver we're using, it comes with an antenna that has a magnet, which made it easy to stick onto the car.

- Anyways, start by opening up terminal and entering `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`. It's the obvious first step but for some reason I thought I could forego doing this. The result of skipping this means you just straight up cannot install GPSD. Let that run, it might take a while.
- Next, type `sudo apt-get install gpsd`. Once that's done type `sudo apt-get install gpsd-clients`. These two commands will install GPSD and the dependencies/packagaes.

- At this point, you'll want to connect your GPS receiver to your RPI. However you choose to go about about it, serial or USB. If for some reason you're a masochist and chose the same receiver as us, you'll initially want to move the yellow caps to the A position and plug it in via USB. This means it will receive and transfer data correctly, instead of through a serial connection. Once that's plugged in, you'll see two of the four lights turn on. The far left one, TXD, means that there's data being transferred. The far right one, PWR, means it's receiving power. Within 30 seconds to a minute, you should then see the third and most important light turn on, which is the PPS light. This means the receiver is actually tracking the GPS location. If this light doesn't come on, nothing will work. Initially, it wouldn't come on for us. This was probably because we were working in an isolated classroom with no windows. Once we moved to a more open area, the GPS was quickly able to track our location. If you can't stick the antenna outside, placing it on or near a window should work just fine.
- Back in your terminal window, type `cgps -s`. This
