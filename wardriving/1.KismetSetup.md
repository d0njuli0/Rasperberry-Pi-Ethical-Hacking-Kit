# Kismet Setup
- Kismet should come pre-installed on the latest Kali distribution, but incase you don't have it, you can find the offical installation guide [here](https://www.kismetwireless.net/docs/readme/intro/kismet/). In any case, just by opening up a shell and typing `apt-get install kismet` will either install it for you or confirm that you have it installed.
- Once that's done, go ahead and plug in your network adapter. For this project, we're using a [Panda Wireless PAU05](https://www.amazon.com/Panda-300Mbps-Wireless-USB-Adapter/dp/B00EQT0YK2). Confirm that it's plugged in succesfully by typing `ip a`. The output of this command should display three different network interfaces. The one we're focusing on is wlan0.
- To put this interface into monitoring mode, type `sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`. Once that is done, running `ip a` again will show that wlan0 now says wlan0mon.
- Now start up Kismet with `sudo kismet -c wlan0mon`. Depending on where you are when you do this, you may be flooded with results as Kismet is scanning for devices and networks. At the top of your shell window, you should see a prompt stating to connect to `http://localhost:2501`. This is the Kismet webserver that collects all the information we're scanning for and presents it in more user-friendly UI. Type in the URL it presents to see the collection of data.
