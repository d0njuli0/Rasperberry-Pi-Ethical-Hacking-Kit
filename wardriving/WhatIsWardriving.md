# What is Wardriving?
Wardriving is the act of searching for wireless networks and devices from a moving vehicle. It can be used as a hacking method in which a threat actor would drive around while mapping access points, potentially locating vulnerable or unsecure devices and networks. There are no laws stating that Wardriving is illegal, but potentially illegal and harmful actions can be taken with the information gained from Wardriving.

# Origins of Wardriving
Per Fortinet, Wardriving originates from a movie called WarGames, where Matthew Broderick dials every phone in his local area to discover computers. This eventually evolved into a process of mapping access points. The term Wardriving was created by computer security consultant Peter Shipley.

# How can this be accomplished?
The purpose of this file within the repository is to demonstrate how Wardriving can be conducted in a simple, cost-efficient manner. With a Raspberry Pi and a few other auxillary pieces of hardware, we can quickly begin our Wardrive.
