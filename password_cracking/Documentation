To begin with our password cracking demonstration we utilized ChatGPT to help create a script to generate passwords with parameters of our choosing. This took a while, because the AI struggled to make the script run properly. However, after some troubleshooting, we realized we needed to make a file that included symbols so we could utilize them in the password generation.  We then did some research on how to utilize hydra to hack into another Raspberry Pi. We decided to run the password cracking script off of Paul’s computer and hack into Cannon’s PI through port 22 (ssh). The hydra command we ran was hydra -l kali -P password1.txt 10.53.19.193 ssh. It is important to make sure you are in the directory where the wordlist is located, or the command will not work properly. Cracking the password worked easily on our first try and the only troubleshooting we had to do was with the script to generate the passwords.
