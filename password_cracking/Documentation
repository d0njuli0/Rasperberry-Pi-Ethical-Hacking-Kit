# Password Cracking via SSH

To begin with our password cracking demonstration we utilized ChatGPT to help create a script to generate passwords with parameters of our choosing. This took a while, because the AI struggled to make the script run properly. However, after some troubleshooting, we realized we needed to make a file that included symbols so we could utilize them in the password generation. 

1. **Generate Passwords Script:**
    - Utilize the script we have provided for generating passwords.
    - Ensure the script can include symbols in the generated passwords.

2. **Research on Hydra:**
    - Learn about Hydra, a powerful tool for password cracking.
    - Explore how to utilize Hydra for cracking passwords over SSH.

3. **Setting Up for Password Cracking:**
    - Decide which machine to run the password cracking script from.
    - Identify the target machine and the port to crack (in this case, port 22 for SSH).

4. **Running Hydra Command:**
    - Run the Hydra command with appropriate parameters:
      ```
      hydra -l kali -P password1.txt <insert IP here> ssh
      ```
    - Ensure you are in the directory where the wordlist (password1.txt) is located, or the command will not work properly.

5. **Cracking Password:**
    - Execute the Hydra command and observe the results.
    - If successful, the password will be displayed once found.

6. **Troubleshooting:**
    - If facing issues, troubleshoot as necessary, possibly with the script for generating passwords.

7. **Conclusion:**
    - Reflect on the success of the password cracking attempt and any challenges encountered during the process.
